# liteTAGI
Basic Python implementation of TAGI (Tractable Approximate Gaussian Inference).

It doesn't manage either batches or multiple outputs.

See complete C++/CUDA library [cuTAGI](https://github.com/lhnguyen102/cuTAGI), and corresponding documentation in [tagiml.com](www.tagiml.com)

It also contains simple noise inference with AGVI. And TAGI-V for handling heteroscedastic aleatory uncertainty for regression tasks.
